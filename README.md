[![GitHub Repo](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-Repository-blue)](https://github.com/Ayush-ak87/ML-Project.git)

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting student performance using machine learning techniques. By constructing an end-to-end ML pipeline, the project automates the entire workflow from data ingestion, transformation, and model training to real-time predictions using a Flask-based API. The model is deployed on various cloud platforms for scalability and accessibility.

## Key Features
- **End-to-End ML Pipeline:** Covers the complete machine learning workflow, including data ingestion, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Insightful visualizations and statistical analysis to explore and understand data patterns.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creation of new features and optimization to improve model accuracy.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Systematic approach to find the best hyperparameters for optimal model performance.
- **Flask-Based API:** Developed a real-time prediction pipeline using Flask for easy deployment and integration.
- **Cloud Deployment:** Model deployed on cloud platforms for real-world accessibility and scalability.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Ingestion:** Loading and cleaning the dataset.
2. **EDA and Visualization:** Conducting in-depth analysis of the dataset to gain insights into student performance.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Creating meaningful features from raw data to improve model performance.
4. **Model Training and Evaluation:** 
    - Implementing various machine learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost).
    - Evaluating models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Fine-tuning the models to enhance performance using grid search or random search.
6. **Model Deployment:**
    - Created a REST API using Flask for real-time predictions.
    - Deployed the trained model on cloud platforms like AWS, Azure etc.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages:** Python
- **Libraries & Tools:** 
  - **Pandas, NumPy:** Data manipulation and analysis
  - **Matplotlib, Seaborn:** Data visualization
  - **Scikit-learn, XGBoost:** Machine learning algorithms and evaluation
  - **Flask:** API development for predictions
  - **Cloud Platforms:** AWS, Heroku (or other cloud services)
  
## Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ayush-ak87/ML-Project.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd ML-Project
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the Flask API:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Usage
Once the Flask API is up and running, you can make a POST request to the endpoint to predict student performance based on the input features.

Example request:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/predict -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
    "feature1": value,
    "feature2": value,
    ...
}'
```

The API will return a prediction based on the trained model.

## Model Evaluation
- Performance of the model is evaluated using accuracy, F1-score, and other classification metrics.
- Hyperparameter tuning is used to ensure optimal performance of the selected model.

## Future Enhancements
- Add more sophisticated models such as neural networks.
- Integrate additional cloud platforms for wider accessibility.
- Enhance API functionality with authentication and logging.
